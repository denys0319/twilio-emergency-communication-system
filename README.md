## Data Storage

The plugin uses a hybrid storage approach:

- **WordPress Database**: Stores contacts, groups, message history, and scheduled messages
  - `wp_ecs_contact_groups` - Contact groups
  - `wp_ecs_contacts` - Individual contacts  
  - `wp_ecs_messages` - Message history with Twilio statuses
  - `wp_ecs_scheduled_messages` - Scheduled message jobs
  - `wp_ecs_message_templates` - Message templates

- **Twilio API**: Handles actual SMS sending and provides real-time delivery status
  - Messages are sent through Twilio's Messages API
  - Status updates are fetched from Twilio for delivery tracking
  - No contact data is stored in Twilio (sent per-message only)

## Security Features

- Nonce verification for all forms and AJAX requests
- Input sanitization and validation
- Capability checks for admin functions
- SQL injection prevention through prepared statements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Twilio Connection Failed**
   - Verify your Account SID and Auth Token are correct
   - Ensure your phone number is in E.164 format
   - Check that your Twilio account has sufficient credits

2. **Messages Not Sending**
   - Verify Twilio credentials in Settings
   - Check that phone numbers are in correct format
   - Ensure your Twilio account is not suspended

3. **File Upload Issues**

   - Check file size limits
   - Verify file format matches expected structure

## Key Concepts

### Message Statuses

**Individual Messages (Message History)**:
- `queued` - Waiting in Twilio queue
- `sending` - Being sent by Twilio
- `sent` - Delivered to carrier
- `delivered` - Delivered to recipient's device âœ…
- `undelivered` - Could not be delivered
- `failed` - Failed to send

**Scheduled Messages**:
- `pending` - Waiting for scheduled time
- `sent` - Job executed successfully
- `cancelled` - User cancelled the job
- `failed` - System error during execution

### Workflow

```
Create Scheduled Message
    â†“
Status: pending (waiting)
    â†“
Cron executes at scheduled time
    â†“
Status: sent (scheduled message)
    â†“
Creates individual messages in Message History
    â†“
Each message: queued â†’ sending â†’ sent â†’ delivered
```
